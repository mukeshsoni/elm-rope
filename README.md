** WIP

Rope data structure implemented in elm. Implemented as per the specs in this wikipedia article [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure))

Motivation for rope data structure, from the wikipedia article -

>  a rope, or cord, is a data structure composed of smaller strings that is used for efficiently storing and manipulating a very long string. For example, a text editing program may use a rope to represent the text being edited, so that operations such as insertion, deletion, and random access can be done efficiently.[
